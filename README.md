## What It Does

GeminiTeacher acts like an AI agent, using a sequence of cascading prompts with Google's Gemini models to perform a comprehensive analysis of your content. First, it intelligently outlines a table of contents with a user-defined number of chapters. It then generates a detailed chapter for each topic in the outline, plus a final course summary, effectively creating a complete, multi-chapter book from your raw material.

GeminiTeacher offers three different generation modes to suit your needs:

- **Sequential Mode (Default)**: Generates chapters one after another, balancing speed and quality.
- **Parallel Mode**: Generates multiple chapters simultaneously for faster processing.
- **Cascade Mode**: Generates chapters sequentially, where each new chapter builds upon all previously generated chapters, creating a more coherent narrative flow.
